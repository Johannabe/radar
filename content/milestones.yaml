#     You can apply for TechLabs Berlin **until Monday, September 28**. All you need to do is to complete the application
#     form linked below.

#     Please note that the survey consists of several questions, some of them require you to reflect on yourself.
#     This is intentional and ensures that we can build a community of very smart and motivated learners.
#     In that way you can be sure that your learning experience will be awesome and that you'll all have a great time.
#     On the other hand, it also means you'll have to invest 20 to 30 minutes. But it'll be worth it, we promise!

    Now it is the time to choose if you want to learn Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Web Development or
    User Experience Design.

    We will post instructions how to choose your track in the Kick-Off Session.

    Please complete the following steps to choose your track:

    1. Complete the track personalization survey.

    After we've received all of your choices, we will evaluate your answers in the track personalization survey.
    Then we will assign you to a track on edyoucated and you can start learning. Please allow some time between
    you completing the survey and the track assignment as this process involves some manual steps. We will send you a
    message on Slack as soon as you can access your track material on edyoucated.
