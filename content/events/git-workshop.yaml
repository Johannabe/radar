  Git Workshop!

  Git is a tool which allows you to work collaborative with other people on a software project, preventing mistakes and allowing to return to a previous state. TechLabs required the usage of Git from all Techies during the project phase. 

  We **strongly recommend** to attend this session, to be able to use Git. It will be an interactive workshop of 3h.
