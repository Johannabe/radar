  After receiving all the Project Pitches, we are super excited to hear you presenting them!

  Your presentation should be short, 2-3 minutes long as there will be a lot of pitches and you should be mindful of others presenting their ideas, too.
  Everyone will have the chance to ask questions and later select the favorite 3 projects.

  We'll then assign the teams according to your selections and get it all started!
