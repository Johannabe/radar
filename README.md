# Semester Radar - TechLabs Berlin

At TechLabs Berlin, we use the Semester Radar to present the semester to the students as a comprehensive timeline of events and milestones.

It is always referred to as the main source for event details.

## Events and milestones

The main items in the Radar are **Events** and **Milestones**:

- **Events**: weekly events happening throuhgout the semester; each event can have resources attached to it (meeting room link, slides, event recordings, etc)
- **Milestones**: are deadlines for the students throughout the semester; they can include to-dos that the student has to complete by a certain date

They are also displayed differently both in the timeline and in the main events area:

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
