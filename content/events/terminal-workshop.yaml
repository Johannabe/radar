  Terminal Workshop!

  We will provide the Terminal Workshop where you'll learn how to control the system via a text-based interface through the command-line app.

  If you have never worked with the Terminal/Bash/Command Line before we **strongly recommend** to attend this event, to learn the skills required for the Git workshop.
